## Ethical Considerations
- The model should be used as a decision support tool, not as the sole basis for customer interventions.
- Regular monitoring is required to ensure the model remains fair and unbiased across different customer segments.

## Limitations
- The model is trained on historical data and may not capture new or emerging churn patterns.
- Performance may vary across different customer segments.

## Recommendations
- Deploy model in a monitoring framework to track performance over time.
- Retrain periodically with fresh data to maintain accuracy.
- Use model predictions alongside domain expertise for retention strategies.
